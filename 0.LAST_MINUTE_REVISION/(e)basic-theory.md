### Lexical Scope in JavaScript

Lexical scope (or static scope) means that the scope of a variable is determined by its position in the source code during the time of declaration, not at runtime. In JavaScript, this is defined by the structure of the code as written.

---

### How It Works:
1. Variables are accessible within their own scope and any nested scopes (child scopes).
2. A function's scope is determined by where it is declared, not where it is called.
---

### Example:

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
  const outerVariable = "I'm outside!";

  function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable); // Accessible due to lexical scope
  }

  innerFunction();
}

outerFunction();
```

#### Explanation:
- `outerVariable` is declared in the scope of `outerFunction`.
- `innerFunction` has access to `outerVariable` because it is lexically inside the `outerFunction`.
- The scope chain is determined statically (when the code is written).

---

### Key Characteristics of Lexical Scope:
1. Defined by code structure: The scope depends on where variables and functions are written.
2. Closures depend on lexical scope: Functions "remember" their outer scope due to lexical scoping, even if executed outside their original context.

---

### Example with Closure:

```javascript
function outerFunction() {
  const outerVariable = "I'm outside!";

  return function innerFunction() {
    console.log(outerVariable);
  };
}

const closureFunction = outerFunction();
closureFunction(); // "I'm outside!"
```

#### Explanation:
- Even though `innerFunction` is executed outside of `outerFunction`, it still "remembers" the `outerVariable` due to lexical scoping.

### Why Lexical Scope Matters?
1. Predictability: The behavior of code is easier to predict and debug because variables' access depends on the static code structure.
2. Closures: Lexical scope is the foundation for closures, a powerful feature in JavaScript.
