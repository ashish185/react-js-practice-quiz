  **Query**
`Find that engine whose cc is greater than 1900` 
```js
`Display all the engine of the cars` 
db.cars.find({},{"engine.cc":1, _id:0})

//Outputs
/* [
  { engine: { cc: 1199 } },
  { engine: { cc: 1493 } },
  { engine: { cc: 1197 } },
  { engine: { cc: 1493 } },
  { engine: { cc: 1997 } }
] */

`Find that engine whose cc is greater than 1900` 
//With operator engine whose cc is greater than 1900
db.cars.find({"engine.cc": {$gt: 1900}},{"engine.cc":1, _id:0})
//[{ engine: { cc: 1997 } }

```
`Find the cars with engine HAVING cc is 1199 and engine cc 1997` 
```js
db.cars.find({"engine.cc": {$in: [1900, 1997]}}) //‚ö†Ô∏èIf 1997 not present then no results (using and)
```

`Find the cars which is fuelType = Diesel and engine type is TurboCharged` 
```js
db.cars.find({"engine.cc": {$in: [1900, 1997]}}) //‚ö†Ô∏èIf 1997 not present then no results (using and)
```

`Find the cars which is fuelType = Diesel and engine type is TurboCharged` 
```js
db.cars.find({"engine.cc": {$in: [1900, 1997]}}) //‚ö†Ô∏èIf 1997 not present then no results (using and)
```

**Logical operators** 
and, or, nor

- And Operator
Q: Diff between 'and' and 'in'  
Ans: and m hum ek se jada keys de skte h

```js
//üìù'and' receive array directly
db.cars.find({$and: [{fuel_type: "Petrol", transmission:'Automatic'}]})
```
**Element Operators**
- $exists
- $type: useful to find field with null value
- $size
- $all

`Find all the cars whose fuel_type field exists in db` 
```js
//üìù'and' receive array directly
db.cars.find({fuel_type: {$exists: true}})
```

`Find all the cars whose fuel_type is null` 
```js
//üìù type must be represented as string
//type can be null, int, string,
db.cars.find({sunroof: {$type: "null"}})
```

`Find all the cars whose features array has size 3` 
```js
//üìù type must be represented as string
//type can be null, int, string,
db.cars.find({features: {$size: 3}})
```
`Find all the cars whose features array has size 3` 
```js
db.cars.find({features: {$all: ['Skyroof']}})
```

**Cursor Methods**
How to find the no. of documents
Count, Sort, Limit, Skip

1. Count

```js
`Find the count of cars records` 
db.cars.find().count() //5

`Find the count of cars whose fuel type is petrol` 
db.cars.find({fuel_type: "petrol"}).count() //5
```
2. Sort

```js
db.cars.find({},{_id:0, model:1}).sort({model:1}) // -1 for descending order
/* 
[
  { model: 'Baleno' },
  { model: 'Creta' },
  { model: 'Nexon' },
  { model: 'Seltos' },
  { model: 'XUV700' }
]
*/

```
3. Limit
```js
db.cars.find().limit(2)
```
4. skip
```js
db.cars.find().skip(3)
```
