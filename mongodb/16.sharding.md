## Sharding
- Sharding is a method for distributing data across multiple machines. MongoDB uses sharding to support deployments with very large data sets and high throughput operations.

- Database systems with large data sets or high throughput applications can challenge the capacity of a single server.

- For example, high query rates can exhaust the CPU capacity of the server. Working set sizes larger than the system's RAM stress the I/O capacity of disk drives.

`There are two methods for addressing system growth: vertical and horizontal scaling.`
1. `Vertical Scaling`: Increasing RAM of a machine
Limitations in available technology may restrict a single machine from being sufficiently powerful for a given workload.
2. `Horizontal Scaling`:
Expanding the capacity of the deployment only requires adding additional servers as needed, which can be a lower overall cost than high-end hardware for a single machine. The trade off is increased complexity in infrastructure and maintenance for the deployment.

`MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through sharding.`

**Sharded and Non-Sharded Collections**
In a database there could be mixture of collection some could be sharded(shared with servers) collection and some could be non sharded.

Connecting to a Sharded Cluster
You must connect to a mongos router to interact with any collection in the sharded cluster.
