## Indexing
An Index is data structure that improves the speed of query operation by allowing the database
to quickly locate and access the required data without scanning every document in a collection.
- Stores the indexed fielded in sorted order
- When we create indexes it uses space in the memory

`Create the index for those field which are most used to query.`

`Syntax`
```js
db.collection.createIndex({ <field1> :< type1>,<field2> :< type2>, ... }, {<options>})
```

```js
db.users.getIndexes() //üìù By default users has indexes.
 // { v: 2, key: { _id: 1 }, name: '_id_' } ]
db.cars.createIndex({ name: 1}) //name_1
db.users.getIndexes() //üìù By default users has indexes.
/* 
[
  { v: 2, key: { _id: 1 }, name: '_id_' },
  { v: 2, key: { name: 1 }, name: 'name_1' } // ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Name is added in the indexed
]
 */
db.cars.dropIndex("name") // will drop the indexes
```

```js
use sample_mflix
db.movies.find({title:'The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse'}).explain("executionStats") //executionTimeMillis: 16,
db.cars.createIndex({ title: 1}) //name_1
db.movies.find({title:'The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse'}).explain("executionStats") //executionTimeMillis: o,
```

**TYPES OF INDEX**
1. `Single Field Index`.
2. `Compound Index`: Involves multiple fields.
3. `Unique Index`: Index that ensures no two documents have the same value for the indexed field.
4. `TTL index(Time to live)`: indexes that are used to automatically removed documents after a certain period.

## Performance Considerations.
- `Impact on Write Operations`: Slow, because index need to maintained
- `Indexing Large Collections`: such as indexing large collections such as index size and impact on RAM.
