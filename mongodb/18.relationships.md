## In Mongo db there is no strict relationship like foreign key like SQL

1. Embedded Documents (Denormalization)
2. Reference document (Normalization): 

Types of Relationships
1. One to One: An Instagram User has one profile only
2. One to Many: An Instagram User has many posts
3. Many to Many: A student can opt many course and course can choose by multiple students

**One to Many**
- In E-commerce user can have multiple orders.
Below is like foreign key relationship but it is not strict(it will allow to delete other table)

## Reference document like Join in SQL
`Creating the database first`

```js
//INPUT
{
  _id: 'user1',
  name: 'Amit Sharma',
  email: 'amit.sharma@example.com',
  phone: '+91-987654210',
  address: 'MG Road, Mumbai, Maharashtra'
}

{
  _id: 'order1',
  user_id: 'user1',
  product: 'Laptop',
  amount: 50000,
  order_date: '2024-08-01'
}
```

```js
//connect to shell
use user_orders
db.users.insertMany([]);
db.orders.insertMany([]);
db.orders.find();
db.users.find();
```

`Creating the database first`

```js
db.users.aggregate([
    {
        "$lookup": {
            "from": "orders", // The target collection to join with
            "localField": "_id", // field with users collection
            "foreignField": "user_id",  //User id of of Orders
            "as": "orders", // The name of the new array field to add to the users.
        }
    }
])
```
```js
//Outputs
{
  _id: 'user1',
  name: 'Amit Sharma',
  email: 'amit.sharma@example.com',
  phone: '+91-987654210',
  address: 'MG Road, Mumbai, Maharashtra',
  orders: [
    {
      _id: 'order1',
      user_id: 'user1',
      product: 'Laptop',
      amount: 50000,
      order_date: '2024-08-01'
    },
    {
      _id: 'order3',
      user_id: 'user1',
      product: 'Headphones',
      amount: 2000,
      order_date: '2024-08-10'
