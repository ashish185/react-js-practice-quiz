**User Variables**
We have to use double dollar $$ with variable
```js
price_variable=1500000
db.cars.find({price: price_variable})
```
-  How to list all the variables?
```js
Object.keys(this);
```


**System Variables**
We have to use double dollar $$ with variable
```js
db.cars.aggregate({$project:{_id:0,model:1,date:"$$NOW"}})
```
System variables in MongoDB aggregation pipelines allow you to access metadata or contextual information about the operation. These variables start with a dollar sign (`$`) and include special variables like `$$NOW`, `$$ROOT`, `$$CURRENT`, and more. Here's a summary of commonly used system variables in MongoDB aggregation:

### Common System Variables in Aggregation:

1. **`$$ROOT`**:  
   Refers to the root document of the pipeline stage. Useful when you need access to the entire document after certain transformations.

2. **`$$CURRENT`**:  
   Refers to the current document being processed in the pipeline. Similar to `$$ROOT` but changes as documents are transformed.

3. **`$$NOW`**:  
   Represents the current date and time when the aggregation query is executed. Useful for comparisons involving time.

4. **`$$CLUSTER_TIME`**:  
   Represents the current cluster time when the aggregation query is executed. Typically used in replica set or sharded cluster setups.

5. **`$$DESCEND`**:  
   Used in `$redact` stages to indicate which documents to include or exclude when traversing arrays.

6. **`$$PRUNE`**:  
   Also used in `$redact` to exclude certain documents or fields.

7. **`$$KEEP`**:  
   Used in `$redact` to include specific documents or fields without modification.

8. **`$$REMOVE`**:  
   Used in certain array update contexts to remove an array element.

9. **`$$SEARCH_META`**:  
   Used in Atlas Search to access metadata about search scores.

10. **`$$USER_ROLES`**:  
    Represents the roles assigned to the authenticated user executing the aggregation. Often used in role-based access control.

### Example Use Cases:

#### Using `$$ROOT`:
```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
    {
        $project: {
            order_id: 1,
            total_price: 1,
            original_document: "$$ROOT" // Includes the entire original document
        }
    }
]);
```

#### Using `$$NOW`:
```javascript
db.users.aggregate([
    {
        $project: {
            name: 1,
            accountAgeInDays: {
                $divide: [
                    { $subtract: [$$NOW, "$account_created"] },
                    1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 // Convert milliseconds to days
                ]
            }
        }
    }
]);
```

#### Using `$$CURRENT`:
```javascript
db.inventory.aggregate([
    {
        $addFields: {
            adjustedStock: { $multiply: ["$$CURRENT.stock", 0.9] } // Adjust stock by 10%
        }
    }
]);
```

#### Using `$redact` with `$$DESCEND`, `$$PRUNE`, and `$$KEEP`:
```javascript
db.documents.aggregate([
    {
        $redact: {
            $cond: {
                if: { $eq: ["$sensitive", true] },
                then: "$$PRUNE", // Exclude sensitive data
                else: "$$KEEP"   // Keep non-sensitive data
            }
        }
    }
]);
```

These system variables can make your aggregation pipelines much more powerful by allowing dynamic references and operations within the pipeline. Let me know if you'd like to explore any of these further!
