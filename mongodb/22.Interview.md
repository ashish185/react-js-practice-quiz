**How would you optimize a MongoDB query for better performance?**
Answer: To optimize a MongoDB query:
· Use indexes effectively.
· Avoid full collection scans by using selective queries.
. Limit the amount of data returned by using projections.
. Use the explain() method to analyze query performance.
· Consider denormalization to reduce the number of joins.

**Describe the process of migrating data from a relational database to MongoDB. What challenges might you face**
Answer: The migration process involves:
· Analyzing the relational schema.
· Designing a MongoDB schema, often using denormalization and
embedding.
· Exporting data from the relational database (e.g., using SQL queries).
. Importing data into MongoDB (e.g., using mongoimport or custom
scripts).
· Challenges: Schema design differences, handling joins, data type
conversion, and ensuring data consistency during migration.

**Explain how MongoDB's aggregation framework works. What are some common stages used in an aggregation pipeline?**

Answer: The aggregation framework in MongoDB allows for
processing data in a pipeline, where each stage transforms the data.
Common stages include:
· $match: Filters documents based on a condition.
· $group: Groups documents by a specified key and performs
aggregation operations.
· $sort: Sorts documents.
· $project: Reshapes the documents by including/excluding fields.
· $lookup: Performs a left join with another collection.

**How does MongoDB handle transactions, and what is the significance of multi-document transactions?**
Answer: MongoDB supports multi-document transactions,
which allow for ACID-compliant operations across multiple
documents or collections. This ensures that either all
operations within a transaction are applied, or none are,
providing consistency and reliability in complex operations.

**What are the pros and cons of embedding documents versus using references in MongoDB?**
Embedding (Pros):
. Better performance for read operations.
· Simpler queries.
Embedding (Cons):
. Can lead to large documents and duplication of data.
References (Pros):
· More normalized data structure.
. Reduces duplication.
References (Cons):
. Requires additional queries (joins) which can be slower.

**How does MongoDB handle concurrency and ensure data consistency?**
Answer: MongoDB handles concurrency using a combination of locks
(e.g., collection-level locks) and journaling. It uses the WiredTiger
storage engine, which provides document-level locking, allowing for
higher concurrency. Consistency is maintained through replica sets
and transactions.

**What is the difference between updateOne(), updateMany(), and replaceOne() in MongoDB?**
Answer:
. updateOne(): Updates the first document that matches the query
criteria.
. updateMany(): Updates all documents that match the query
criteria.
· replaceOne(): Replaces the entire document with a new one,
based on the query criteria.

**Explain the concept of TTL (Time to Live) indexes in MongoDB and when they might be useful.**
Answer: TTL indexes automatically delete documents from a
collection after a specified period. This is useful for data that
becomes irrelevant after a certain time, such as session logs,
temporary data, or caching.

**What are MongoDB's limitations, and how can you work around them?**
Answer: Limitations include:
· No built-in support for joins (use aggregation or manual joins).
· Limited support for multi-document ACID transactions (introduced in later
versions).
· Large documents can impact performance (use references to mitigate).
· Working around limitations often involves thoughtful schema design,
indexing, and understanding MongoDB's strengths.

**Explain the role of journaling in MongoDB. How does it help in ensuring durability?**
Answer: Journaling in MongoDB is a mechanism that logs write
operations to a journal file before applying them to the database. In
case of a crash, MongoDB can use the journal to recover to a consistent
state, ensuring durability of write operations.
