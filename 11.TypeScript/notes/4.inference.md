## Type Inference('anuman lagana')
Inference by assigning some value it automatically detects what will be the type of variable.

- Example 1: Where we assign string.
```js
let x= "any value";
/* It will show hover error, as per inference x should be string */

x=1; //Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'
```
- Example 1: Where fixed let variable that it has 5 only.
```js
let y:5;
y=5; //no error
y=10; //Error Type '10' is not assignable to type '5'

```
