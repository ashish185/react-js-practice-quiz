This is more naturally supported with type.
```js
type ReadOnly<T> = {
  readonly [K in keyof T]: T[K];
};

type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

const user: ReadOnly<User> = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
};

// Error: Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.
// user.name = "Bob";

```
