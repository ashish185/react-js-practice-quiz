What is Idempotant?
jo chij server ko bar bar request dene par effect nhi krti.
GET,PUT,DELETE,GET,HEAD,OPTIONS are Idempotant
POST,PATCH, CONNECT are not idempotent

Several common HTTP methods are safe: GET, HEAD, or OPTIONS.
All safe methods are also idempotent, but not all idempotent methods are safe. 
For example, PUT and DELETE are both idempotent but unsafe.
