## NACL
- To allow or deny ip's in VPC.
- Esme Rules rank base kam krte h, means suppose two rules with 101:X, 99:Y. Rule y execute first.

Problem: Suppose I am using EC2 instance micro, and there are lot of request coming on it from attackers,
so it can cause memory outage.
Pattern: the ip adress of incoming 5 request were some

- To Prevent it
1. Can we use the security groups?
- Ans: No, Here we only request allow the ip adreesss, subnet, and port. we cannot deny it.

2. 
**How to block ip adress via NACL**
Practical USE case
1. An EC2 instance created with public subnet.
2. When we try to ping EC2 instance by copying the public ip of it and ping via cmd. It does not return back.
- Go to security group of ec2.
- In Inbound rule, allow `type` as `All ICMP-IPV4` and `source` is `anywhere`
