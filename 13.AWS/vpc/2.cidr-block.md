## CIDR block

- CIDR: Class Inter Domain Routing .
- CIDR block define the IP ranges for the entire VPC. For ex:
  `10.0.0.0/16`
  This block allows: 65,536 IP addresses bun in reality(65,531 are usable)
- For Routing or allocation ip addresses and routing protocol IP address.
  CIDR.xyz

  **Explain**

  - IPv4: 32 bit
  Adress of IP can go from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255.
  32 bit where each unit is 8 bit, total: 2^32

  - IPv6: 128 bit
  Short term solution is CIDR

  **Q: How to find range /24, /16?**
    If you need 100 server
    192.168.0.0 - 192.168.0.255
    So 192.168.0 can be static, therefor 8bit*3=24bit can be static.
    Therefore range could be 192.168.0.0/           
    192.168.0.1: here 1 is `Host id` and 192.168.0 which is static becomes `Netowork ID`
