### **What Are Policies in AWS?**
AWS **Policies** are JSON-based documents that define permissions for users, groups, and roles in AWS. They control access to AWS resources by specifying what actions are allowed or denied.

## **Types of Policies in AWS**
1. **Identity-Based Policies** (IAM Policies)  
   - Attached to **Users, Groups, or Roles**.  
   - Define permissions to access AWS services.  
   - Example:
     ```json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
           "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

2. **Resource-Based Policies**  
   - Attached directly to **AWS resources** (e.g., S3 buckets, SNS topics).  
   - Controls access at the resource level.  
   - Example: S3 Bucket Policy allowing public read access:
     ```json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Principal": "*",
           "Action": "s3:GetObject",
           "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

3. **Permissions Boundaries**  
   - Set the **maximum permissions** a user or role can have.  
   - Even if an IAM policy allows an action, it wonâ€™t be allowed if it's outside the boundary.

4. **AWS Organizations Service Control Policies (SCPs)**  
   - Used in **AWS Organizations** to manage permissions across multiple accounts.  
   - Cannot grant permissionsâ€”only **restricts** them.

5. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**  
   - Used for controlling access to **S3 buckets and objects**.  
   - Works at the **network level**, unlike IAM policies.

6. **Session Policies**  
   - Temporary policies assigned when using AWS **STS (Security Token Service)**.  
   - Used for short-term access control.

## **How Policies Work in AWS**
1. **Explicit Deny Takes Precedence**: If a policy denies an action, it overrides any Allow.
2. **Explicit Allow Grants Access**: If no Deny exists, an Allow statement grants permission.
3. **Default is Deny**: If an action isnâ€™t explicitly allowed, itâ€™s denied by default.
