## What is .tfvars file terraform?

**Problem**: If there are multiple variables in the input from cmd, then it is a problem.

**rule**
if file name is `terraform.tf vars` it automatically takes the input from command prompt

**Question: Can we give another name of this file?**
Ans: Yes, but you need to specify the name of file from where the terraform takes the input.
```shell
terraform plan -var-file=development.tfvars -var-file=common.tfvars
```
