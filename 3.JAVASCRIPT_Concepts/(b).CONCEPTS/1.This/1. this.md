## This pointer
Points to remember
1.  It also has some differences between strict mode and non-strict mode.
    ```javascript
    function regular(){
        //In not strict mode it is global object
        console.log("regular non strict", this); //Undefined
        //In non strict mode If a function is called with this set to undefined or null, this gets substituted with globalThis.
    }
    regular();
    
    function regularStrict(){
    "use strict";
     //In strict mode it is undefined
      console.log("regular strict", this);
    }
    regularStrict();
    ```
2.  Value of this is determined by how a function is called (runtime binding)
   ```js
   function regularStrict(){
    "use strict";
      console.log("regular strict", this);//window object
    }
    //Calling it via window object
    window.regularStrict(); 
   ```
3.  Arrow functions don't provide their own this binding (it retains the this value of the enclosing lexical context).
   ```js
   const arrow = () => {
    //In not strict mode it is global object
    console.log(this === window); //true
    }
    arrow();
   ```
4.  In non strict modeIf a function is called with this set to undefined or null, this gets substituted with globalThis.
    ```javascript
    function regular(){
        console.log(this); //Global object
    }
    regular();
    ```
