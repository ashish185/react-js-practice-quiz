## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
JS does not have Interfaces though.
- The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is a concept in object-oriented design that states that clients
should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

```js
class A{
    method1(){
    }

    method2(){

    }
}

class B extends A{
    method2(){
        //Here B do not want to use the method2 of class A. Therefor it returns null
        //SO ISP principles violet here.
        return null;
    }
}

```
