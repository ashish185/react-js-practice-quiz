from the start of the block until the initialization has completed.
In ECMAScript 6, accessing a let or const variable before its declaration (within its scope) 
causes a ReferenceError. The time span when that happens, 
between the creation of a variableâ€™s binding and its declaration, is called the temporal dead zone.

1) let and const Both have local scope, but var has global scope

4) let and const are more strict than var.
