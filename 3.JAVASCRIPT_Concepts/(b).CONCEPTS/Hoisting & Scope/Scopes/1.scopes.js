/** what is Scope?
Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of these variables.

(mdn)
JavaScript has the following kinds of scopes:

1. Global scope: The default scope for all code running in script mode.
2. Module scope: The scope for code running in module mode.
3. Function scope: The scope created with a function.

In addition, variables declared with let or const can belong to an additional scope:
4. Block scope: The scope created with a pair of curly braces (a block).
