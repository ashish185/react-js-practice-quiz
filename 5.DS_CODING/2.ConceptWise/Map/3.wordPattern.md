## 290. Word Pattern
Solved
Easy

**Description**: Given a pattern and a string s, find if s follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s. Specifically:

Each letter in pattern maps to exactly one unique word in s.
Each unique word in s maps to exactly one letter in pattern.
No two letters map to the same word, and no two words map to the same letter.
 
1. Example 1:

Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat dog" Output: true

Explanation:

The bijection can be established as:

'a' maps to "dog".
'b' maps to "cat".
2. Example 2:

Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish" Output: false

3. Example 3:

Input: pattern = "aaaa", s = "dog cat cat dog" Output: false

4. (**SELF THINK) Example 4:
Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog dog dog dog" Output: false // Since vice versa should be considered.

Constraints:

1 <= pattern.length <= 300
pattern contains only lower-case English letters.
1 <= s.length <= 3000
s contains only lowercase English letters and spaces ' '.
s does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
All the words in s are separated by a single space.
