Here are some data structure and algorithm (DSA) questions that might initially seem solvable with a map (hashmap/dictionary), but using a map is not the optimal approach:

---

### 1. **Finding Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**
   - **Initial Thought**: Use a map to store the last occurrence of each character and compute the substring.
   - **Better Way**: Use two pointers or the sliding window technique with a set to track unique characters. This avoids unnecessary overhead of maintaining indices in a map.

---

### 2. **Finding Pair with Given Sum in a Sorted Array**
   - **Initial Thought**: Use a map to store elements and find their complements.
   - **Better Way**: Since the array is sorted, use the two-pointer technique to find the pair in \(O(n)\) time without extra space.

---

### 3. **Counting Inversions in an Array**
   - **Initial Thought**: Use a map to count occurrences and track inversions manually.
   - **Better Way**: Use a merge sort-based algorithm that counts inversions during the merge step. This approach has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\).

---

### 4. **Finding Majority Element in an Array**
   - **Initial Thought**: Use a map to count the frequency of each element.
   - **Better Way**: Use the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm, which works in \(O(n)\) time and \(O(1)\) space.

---

### 5. **Find K Closest Points to the Origin**
   - **Initial Thought**: Use a map to store distances of points from the origin.
   - **Better Way**: Use a max-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the \(k\) closest points, which is more space-efficient and faster for large \(k\).

---

### 6. **Finding the Smallest Window Containing All Characters of a String**
   - **Initial Thought**: Use a map to count character frequencies in the window.
   - **Better Way**: Use the sliding window technique with a single array (if character set size is fixed, e.g., ASCII).

---

### 7. **Detecting Cycle in a Graph**
   - **Initial Thought**: Use a map to track visited nodes.
   - **Better Way**: Use union-find (disjoint-set) to detect cycles in an undirected graph or DFS with a visited and recursion stack for a directed graph.

---

### 8. **Finding Duplicates in a Range**
   - **Initial Thought**: Use a map to store the counts of elements.
   - **Better Way**: If the range of numbers is known and limited, use a boolean array or in-place marking (e.g., modifying the input array).

---

### 9. **Kth Largest Element in a Stream**
   - **Initial Thought**: Use a map to store frequencies and determine the \(k\)th largest.
   - **Better Way**: Use a min-heap of size \(k\), which is more efficient for dynamically maintaining the largest \(k\) elements.

---

### 10. **Two Strings Are Anagrams**
   - **Initial Thought**: Use a map to count character frequencies.
   - **Better Way**: Use an array of size 26 (if limited to lowercase letters) or 256 (for ASCII) to store counts, which is faster and uses less space.

---

These examples highlight how the **initial temptation to use a map** might not lead to the best solution in terms of time or space complexity. The better approaches often leverage specialized data structures or algorithms tailored to the problem.
