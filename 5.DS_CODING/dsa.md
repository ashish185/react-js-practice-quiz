1. Two Pointers

Given a sorted array and a target sum, find two numbers that add up to the target. (This combines elements from potential responses A and B.)
Remove duplicates from a sorted array in-place (without using extra space).
2. Intervals

Merge overlapping intervals.
Given a set of intervals, find the interval that intersects with the most other intervals.
3. Arrays

Find the maximum subarray sum. (A classic and widely asked question.)
Given an array of integers, find the number that occurs more than half the time (or determine if such a number exists). (This incorporates elements from both potential responses.)
4. Dynamic Programming

Fibonacci sequence (iterative or recursive approach).
Longest common subsequence (LCS) problem.
5. DFS-BFS

Given a graph and a source node, perform a BFS traversal and print the visited nodes.
Find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph (using BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm).
6. Binary Search

Search for a specific element in a sorted array using binary search.
Find the first or last occurrence of an element in a sorted array (handling duplicates if necessary).
7. Tree Traversal

Implement in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals of a binary tree (recursive and iterative approaches).
Given a binary tree, check if it's a binary search tree (BST).
8. Sliding Window

Find the maximum sum of a subarray of size k in an array of integers.
Find the longest substring without repeating characters.
9. Backtracking

Solve the N-Queens problem (placing N queens on an N x N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other).
Generate all combinations of a given set of elements.
10. Strings

Reverse a string (in-place and without using extra space if possible).
Check if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

11. Binary Search on Strings

Given a sorted array of strings and a target string, find the index of the target string using binary search (assuming lexicographical order, meaning alphabetical order).
Find the first occurrence of a specific character in a sorted string using binary search (consider variations like case sensitivity or handling multiple occurrences).
