A **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack** is a cybersecurity threat where an attacker secretly intercepts and potentially alters the communication between two parties (e.g., a user and a website), without either party knowing. This allows the attacker to steal sensitive information, inject malicious content, or impersonate one of the parties.

### **How MITM Attacks Work**
1. **Interception**:
   - The attacker positions themselves between the victim and the intended recipient, either by:
     - Exploiting insecure networks (e.g., public Wi-Fi).
     - Using DNS spoofing, ARP spoofing, or malicious proxies.
2. **Eavesdropping**:
   - The attacker captures data sent between the two parties (e.g., login credentials, personal details).
3. **Manipulation (Optional)**:
   - The attacker may alter the communication, inject malicious scripts, or impersonate one of the parties.

### **Types of MITM Attacks**
| **Type**               | **Description**                                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Wi-Fi Eavesdropping**| Attacker sets up a rogue Wi-Fi access point to intercept data on an insecure network.          |
| **SSL Stripping**      | Downgrades HTTPS to HTTP, allowing the attacker to read unencrypted data.                      |
| **DNS Spoofing**       | Redirects users to malicious websites by tampering with DNS responses.                        |
| **ARP Spoofing**       | Maps the attackerâ€™s MAC address to the IP address of the victim, intercepting traffic on LAN.  |
| **Email Hijacking**    | Intercepts communication between users and their email servers to steal sensitive information. |

### **MITM Attack Lifecycle**
1. **Preparation**: The attacker gains access to the communication channel (e.g., Wi-Fi network or device).
2. **Interception**: Data is captured as it passes between the victim and the intended recipient.
3. **Exploit**: The attacker steals data, injects malicious payloads, or impersonates one of the parties.

### **Consequences of MITM Attacks**
1. **Data Theft**: Login credentials, banking information, and personal data may be stolen.
2. **Identity Theft**: Impersonation for fraud or unauthorized access.
3. **Session Hijacking**: Control of an authenticated session to impersonate the victim.
4. **Malware Injection**: Inserting malicious scripts or content into the communication.

### **How to Prevent MITM Attacks**
| **Protection Method**          | **Details**                                                                                      |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use HTTPS**                  | Ensure websites use secure HTTPS connections to encrypt communication.                           |
| **Avoid Public Wi-Fi**         | Avoid accessing sensitive data over public or unsecured networks.                               |
| **VPN**                        | Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt internet traffic.                                |
| **Enable HSTS**                | The **HSTS** header forces browsers to use HTTPS, preventing SSL stripping attacks.              |
| **DNSSEC**                     | Protects against DNS spoofing by verifying DNS responses.                                        |
| **Regular Updates**            | Keep devices, operating systems, and software patched to fix vulnerabilities.                   |
| **Avoid Phishing**             | Be cautious of emails or links that may lead to malicious websites.                             |

### **Example of MITM Attack**
1. **Scenario**: 
   - A user connects to a public Wi-Fi network named `Free_WiFi`.
   - The attacker operates this network and intercepts all traffic.
2. **Outcome**:
   - The attacker captures unencrypted login credentials or payment information.
   - The attacker may inject malicious redirects or ads into the victim's browsing session.
